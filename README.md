# BPP Pages

[Monty pages](https://shoeffner.github.io/monty)

These are the GitHub pages for the Basic Programming in Python class, taught by
Sebastian Höffner and Aline Vilks during the summmer term 2017 at University of
Osnabrück.

Goal of these pages is to make the compiled lecture notes, homework sheets and
solutions easily available without going through the trouble of installing
pandoc and the needed filters.
