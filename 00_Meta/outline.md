# Organizational issues

- There are no grades for this class, only a Fail/Pass option.
- To pass, work successful on nine (out of 13) homework sheets.
- The final projects will span approximately three of the homework sheets (that
  means they are included, not extra!)


# Additional Material and Advice to learn Python

We did not learn Python with a book or a specific online tutorial, so it would
be foolish to recommend one. But there are many out there when you search the
web for "learning python", "python tutorials", etc.
One word of advice though: Many tutorials are a little bit older and use
Python 2, while we teach Python 3. There are not too many differences you
should be concerned about, but these are important:

- `/` works slightly different on integers
- `print` needs no parentheses and has different arguments
- `import ... from __future__` is often used to get new language features of
  Python 3 in Python 2

The best way to learn Python (and programming in general) is to just do
something. Try to solve a problem of your own, and when you can not solve it,
try to figure out what blocks you and search the web for a solution. Websites
like the Python documentation or [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
will usually have an answer. If not: Why don't you ask a question in class (or
post one on the internet)?
