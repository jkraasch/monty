# Built-in functions for your everyday tasks

We already discussed some [built-in
functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html), for example:

- `open`: Opens a file
- `str`, `float`, `int`: Casts data to the respective types
- `range`: Generates a sequence of numbers
- `enumerate`: Gives us indices and items for iterations
- `set`, `list`, `tuple`, `dict`: Create the corresponding collections
