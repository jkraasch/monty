% `True or False?`

# Another Data Type: Boolean

There are only two things that can be expressed with the boolean data type: 

+ That something is  **True**

and

+ that something is **False**

\note{
Nevertheless it is an extremely useful and thus important concept in programming.
}

#  Another Data Type: Boolean

We can *assign* these values to variables. For example:

```python 
parrot_alive = True
```

\note{
We put the value "True" into a box with the name "parrot_alive".
}


#  Another Data Type: Boolean

And we can check whether an expression is *true* or *false*. 

```python 
>>> 5 > 42
False

>>> 5 > 1
True
```

We can also check the truth value of previously assigned variables.
``` python
>>> parrot_alive = True

>>> parrot_alive
True
```
