\section*{Introductory Words}
Remember that you need proper documentation to pass
the homework. The documentation doesn't need to be \textit{perfect}, but
everything that needs a docstring, should have a docstring.\\
Make sure that your code does not crash on execution! If your code is not
runnable -- and especially if it is only a typo, and there are no comments
to explain your idea or why it was not fixable \textbf{we will consider that
particular task as failed}.
