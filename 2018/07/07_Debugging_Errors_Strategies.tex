\section{Warm-Up: Debug Like There's No Tomorrow}

This week is going to be all about fixing errors in the code instead of building
your own programs from scratch.\\
Attached to this sheet there is a folder "debug\_me" full of small Python scripts. All of them throw
some sort of exception.\\
Fix the .py files to get rid of the exceptions and to do what they were supposed
to do. Run your version of the code to make sure it actually works.
\textbf{Then put a small comment in each file explaining what was the problem.}\\
