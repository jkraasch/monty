\section{Vector Math}
We can model vectors with tuples and lists. Python however is not equipped with the tools to do vector math, but we can write the functions for this ourselves!\\
Write a script \texttt{vectors.py} which defines the following functions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{add(x, y)}: Adds $x$ and $y$ such that the result follows $z_i = x_i + y_i$.
  \item \texttt{sub(x, y)}: Subtracts $y$ from $x$ such that the result follows $z_i = x_i - y_i$.
  \item \texttt{dot(x, y)}: Calculates the scalar (dot) product (or inner product) of $x$ and $y$. The dot product $<x,y>$ is defined as $<x,y> = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{N}x_iy_i$.
  \item \texttt{angle(x, y)}: Calculates the angle between the between $x$ and $y$. The angle can be found by using an alternative definition of the dot product: $<x,y> = \|x\|\|y|\ \cos\theta$, which we can solve for $\theta$ and we get $\theta = \arccos\dfrac{<x,y>}{\|x|\|y\|}$.\\
  \emph{Note:} $\|x\|$ where $x$ is a vector is called the vector norm and is calculated by $\sqrt{<x,x>}$.
  \item \texttt{pdist(x, y, **kwargs)}: The distance between the two points $x$ and $y$. Your \textit{kwargs} should recognise the keywords \texttt{metric} and \texttt{p}. Your \texttt{metric} keyword should be able to take one of the values \texttt{'euclidean', 'minkowski', 'cityblock'}, and \texttt{p} can take any integer greater or equal to one. The distance is calculated depending on the metric and should default to \texttt{euclidean}. The distances are calculated as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \texttt{euclidean}: $d_{euclid} (x,y) = \sqrt[\uproot{2}2]{\sum\limits_{i=1}^N (x_i-y_i)^2}$.
      \item \texttt{minkowski}: $d_{minkowsky} (x,y) = \sqrt[\uproot{2}\texttt{p}]{\sum\limits_{i=1}^N (x_i-y_i)^\texttt{p}}$.
      \item \texttt{cityblock}: $d_{cityblock} (x,y) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^N \|x_i-y_i\|$\\
      (\emph{Note:} $\|x\|$ is the absolute value.)
    \end{itemize}
    See figure \ref{fig:metrics} for a nicer visualisation.\\
    Don't be afraid of this. It looks scary at first, but it is not beyond the scope of what you already learned.
  \item \textbf{BONUS:} \texttt{cross(x, y)}: calculates the cross product of two vectors. This might be a bit tricky. The cross product will yield a matrix. \Large{TODO}
\end{itemize}
You can assume that all vectors have the same size.

\section{Which to What}
Blabla Todo, something about when to use which collection.

\section{Working together <WIP title>}
In the file \texttt{my\_collection.py} you will find two lists defined: \texttt{subjects} and \texttt{attributes}. 
In the end you should have one dictionary which uses the subject id as a key and a \textit{list} of attributes for the value.
