And Python is second language that I'm learning. The first one is MS Visual Basic (Basic level). And in this introductory Python course I really want to get introductory stuff.

For example, the examples used in lectures are like apples and oranges and I feel like I understand the concepts when I am in class. However, once I get to the homework, I feel completely lost because the questions are on a different level. Perhaps in the lectures, more difficult examples could be used.

10/05/2018 15:24:41,Yes,Generally good. I see you put much effort on the course.,5,"It's not very obvious sometimes, how the method can be implemented, as I don't think as coder yet.

10/05/2018 17:17:04,Yes,It's very helpful and well structured. ,5,"When you introduce a new function, maybe it would be helpful to put the general pattern/template (or however you call it) on the slides. 
E.g. if you were to introduce ""re.sub"", put ""re.sub(pattern, repl, string, count=0, flags=0)"" in a coloured box. Like you did for ""sorted"" in the last lecture (slide 23). That makes understanding the code examples a lot easier.  ",4,3,3,3,Yes,Yes,,4,5,1,"Neural Networks & Deep Learning, PsychoPy (Experiment design in Python), Plotting & Graphing, Data Analysis","I really enjoy taking your class and think you're doing a great job! I especially appreciate the walk-in sessions and that you're so approachable and friendly and always ready to answer questions. :) Also, it's great how you're trying to accommodate our different levels of programming experience, e.g. with the in-depth explanations at the end of the lecture. 

During the lecture, when you explain how a piece of code works (e.g. the different sorting algorithms), maybe you could do it a little slower or twice sometimes. Not because you don't explain it well enough the first time, but just because it gives us more time to understand and wrap our heads around the logic behind it.
What's very helpful is when you use the blackboard to give concrete examples (e.g. for the sorting algorithms when you went through different lists of numbers step by step) - so keep that up please. :)

And finally, it would be interesting to see some examples of how the commands we learn are used in actual ""real life"" programming (e.g. how you would use them when designing an experiment with PsychoPy or something like that). I don't know if that's feasible at all, but it would be interesting for those of us who don't have any programming experience and don't really have an idea how actual code works/looks like in practice. We wouldn't need to understand exactly how the code works in these examples - just so we get an idea of how it can be used. 

So, keep up the good work! :)"
10/05/2018 23:59:37,Yes,I like that the lectures have shortened somewhat and that example coding is being done in the classroom.,3,"Almost all of the information comes from very specific examples that are hard to translate into things like the homework. It would have been nice to learn the most used vocabulary of Python and exactly what that word does, then learn the grammar structure of Python to know exactly where the words fit (especially in what order). Naming the types of variables and laying out a language structure (zb. SubjectNoun_Verb_Adjective_ObjectNoun) would make it easier to apply the examples/explanations to multiple situations.",3,5,2,2,Yes,Yes,"I would actually prefer the homework to be many simple repetitive tasks to actually build a solid foundation in the basics instead of a giant problem that blends everything. It's hard to understand how all the pieces fit together in a large homework problem when I haven't had practice forming the individual elements in their different forms. So then after hours of trying things and failing, I just end up Googling everything and adding those pieces into the homework problem without understanding or caring what is happening.",4,4,1,"Neural Networks & Deep Learning, PsychoPy (Experiment design in Python), Computervision, GUI (graphical user interface) applications","Just remember that coding isn't ""common sense"" and that it is a language. Someone who has been using Python for years and is very proficient at using it can easily overlook and underestimate the very simple pieces that are necessary for those who have never coded before."
