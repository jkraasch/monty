\section{Warm-Up: The Land Before Time}
Many many years ago, our planet was the habitat of many different types of dinosaurs.\\
We modeled several kinds of them and their behavior (in a manner that may or may
not be a little simplified) in a file named \texttt{dinos.py}.\\
Look at the dino classes given in the file. State for each class the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item{All superclasses}
	\item{All subclasses}
	\item{All classes it extends}
	\item{All functions it can use}
	\item{All functions it overrides}
\end{itemize}

\section{I want to ride my bicycle, I want to ride my bike}
Implement three classes: \textit{Bike}, \textit{Bicycle} and \textit{Motorbike}.\\
\textit{Bike} is the superclass of both \textit{Bicycle} and \textit{Motorbike}.\\
A \textit{Bike} has a number of seats and a number of gears. It can start being ridden and
end being ridden. Also, one is able to change the gears (to a gear number that
actually exists.)\\
A \textit{Bicycle}, additionally to the \textit{Bike}, has a bell that can be rung.\\
A \textit{Motorbike}, additionally to the \textit{Bike}, has a tank that can be filled.\\
Write a module of the classes according to the description and add another module
that tests them with some values. Don't forget to include proper documentation!
