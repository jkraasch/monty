"""
This module simulates a battle between two knights.

The module expects a module named `knights` to be available, which supplies
the following constants and classes:
    MAX_ATTRIBUTE_POINTS: which holds how many attribute points a knight can spend
    ATTRIBUTES: a list of attributes on which the points can be spent on
    
    KnightError: A class that can be raised for errors in knighting a new knight
    Knight: A class that represents a knight, whose constructor takes a name and
        one parameter for each available attribute.

        So if the available attributes are strength and vitality the knight should
        be constructed with Knight(name, strength_value, vitality_value)
