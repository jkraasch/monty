\section{Warm-Up}
\subsection{Read \& Write}
In the file \texttt{task\_1.txt}, is an unsorted list of numbers. Read in the list, sort it in \textit{descending} order and write it back to the file.
In the end the file should only contain the sorted list.\\
\cprotect\sol{
\begin{python}
import re


with open("./task_1.txt", "r+") as f:
    lst_in = f.read() # read the list as string
    lst_in = re.sub("(\[|\])", "", lst_in) # get rid of the brackets
    # split on the commas of the list,
    # and cast to float since we are dealing with numbers
    lst = [float(x) for x in lst_in.split(",")]
    lst.sort(reverse=True) # and sort
    f.write(str(lst)) # back in the file it goes
\end{python}
}

\subsection{Key Sort}
Given a list of the following structure:
\begin{python}
my_lst = [
  {
    "key1" : value1,
    "key2" : value2,
    "key3" : value3
  },
  {
    "key1" : a_value,
    "key2" : b_value,
    "key3" : c_value
  },
  ...
]
\end{python}
Sort the list in such a way, that the value of \texttt{"key2"} is used to compare and sort the dictionaries inside the list.\\
\cprotect\sol{
\begin{python}
sorted(my_lst, key=lambda x: x["key2"])
\end{python}
}
