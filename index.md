# Course material

This website will be updated whenever we publish new sheets, solutions or lecture slides.
If you find any mistakes, have some questions or anything else, feel free to drop me a line (shoeffner@uos.de).

[Course outline](files/BPP-Outline.pdf) (subject to change)

    * [Homework sheet](files/BPP-01_HelloPython-Sheet.pdf)
    * [Solution](files/BPP-01_HelloPython-Solution.pdf)
    * [Solution code](files/BPP-01_HelloPython-Solution.zip)
2. Variables, Assignments, and Functions
    * [Lecture slides](files/BPP-02_VariablesAssignmentsFunctions.pdf)
    * [Lecture code](files/BPP-02_VariablesAssignmentsFunctions.pdf)

*Note:* Once the class is done, we will make the source files available as well
(i.e. the repository). But to keep the solutions *secret* while we go (as our
students receive points for them), it seems to be a good option to publish the
files on this page.
